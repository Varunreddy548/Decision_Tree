# Decision_Tree
A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits data into branches based on feature values, leading to decision outcomes at leaf nodes. Easy to understand and interpret, it models decisions in a tree-like structure, making it useful in data analysis.
