# Decision_Tree
A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits data into branches based on feature values, leading to decision outcomes at leaf nodes. Easy to understand and interpret, it models decisions in a tree-like structure, making it useful in data analysis.

**Introduction**
A decision tree is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It models decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure, which is easy to understand and visualize.

**Structure of a Decision Tree**
A decision tree consists of three main components:

* **Root Node**: Represents the entire dataset and initiates the first split based on a feature.
* **Internal Nodes**: Represent decisions or tests on features.
* **Leaf Nodes**: Indicate the final output or prediction.

**Working Principle**
At each node, the algorithm selects the best feature to split the data using metrics like Gini Index, Entropy (for classification), or Mean Squared Error (for regression). This process continues recursively until a stopping condition is met, such as a maximum tree depth or pure leaf nodes.

**Advantages**

* Easy to interpret and visualize
* Works with both numerical and categorical data
* Requires little data preprocessing

**Limitations**

* Prone to overfitting
* Sensitive to small changes in data
* May create complex trees that donâ€™t generalize well

**Applications**
Decision trees are widely used in areas like healthcare for disease diagnosis, in finance for risk analysis, and in marketing for customer segmentation. They also serve as a foundation for ensemble methods like Random Forest.
